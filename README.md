I'm procrastinating for my winter class, so I made this. Am I employable yet

to get freakyecho, open ur terminal and run `git clone ssh://git@github.com/dollarstorepoetry/freakyecho && cd freakyecho && make`
i'll eventually figure out how uploading this to a package manager works but for now we take the lazy (and probably not secure) approach

only works on linux (and maybe macos) rn. if you're on windows then like what are you doing here idk
