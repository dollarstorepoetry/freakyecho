I'm procrastinating for my winter class, so I made this. Am I employable yet

to get freakyecho, run `git clone ssh://git@github.com/dollarstorepoetry/freakyecho && cd freakyecho/src`, then run `make`

only works on linux (and maybe macos) rn. if you're on windows then like what are you doing here idk
